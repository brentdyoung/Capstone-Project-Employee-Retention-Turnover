Project Description: The People Insights’ team goals are to explore 
employee demographics and employee survey scores in order to 
predict the probability that an employee will leave the company, 
determine which factors prompt employees to leave, 
and create a Stay Survey so that leaders/HR can use the model 
results to retain high risk employees.
